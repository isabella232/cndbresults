\f0\fs24 \cf0 The resilience test has 3 parts:\
\
	-  1. Limit memory: we limit the ram memory in the container of the database and we insert data. The limit is for crate: 250m,  couch and mysql :120m and mongo and postgres: 60m. After we check if there data is in the database.\
	-  2. Kill the container: we kill the database container in the middle of insert the data. After we check if there data is in the database.\
\
	 In 1 and 2, we insert the data one per one or all together. If we do one per one, in the sql database we do or doing commit each time or in the end. The database start we 1000 rows or documents inside the database.\
	 In the json files we can see the count and the real_count. The real_count is the real data inside the database. The count is the variable that count how many times we try to insert a row in the database.\
\
\
         - 3. Disk size: Insert data one per one until there are not space in the disk space. After we check if there data is in the database. In this case all the data is correct in the database. \
