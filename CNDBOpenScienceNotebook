CNDB benchmark results - open science notebook

The experiments described herein were conducted as part of the Cloud-Native
Applications research initiative at the Service Prototyping Lab at Zurich
University of Applied Sciences. The results were partially evaluated
and examined in the paper: «Cloud-Native Databases: An Application Perspective.»

Some further results are summarised in the PDF file in this repository.

The ids 1-18 refer to a private dataset. All other ids refer to the public
dataset corresponding to https://github.com/serviceprototypinglab/cndbbench
in the versions starting from February 2017.

    Selects test documentdb with a local benchmark. 
Date: 
    13/12/2016
Time_start: 10:05
Time_end: 10:05
Description: 
    Selects test running the benchmark in the machine A and the database is a
    instance of Documentdb in Microsoft Azure. The zone is: West Europe.
    (S2/1000 requests/s limit)
Previous steps: 
    Insert in the database documentdb the collections PropertyTypes,
    IDXProperty76, IDXProperty78, IDXProperty79, BlobStore.
Instructions:
    1. Clone the repository arkis/databaseComparison
    2. cd databaseComparison/Benchmark/documentdb
    3. docker build -t documentdbtest ./benchmark
    4. docker-compose up
Results:
    results/13-12-2016/documentdbtest/selectdocumentdb.txt
Conclusions: 
    Exception with error: request rate is large.
    https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/bigdatasupport/2015/09/02/dealing-with-requestratetoolarge-errors-in-azure-documentdb-and-testing-performance/
    It is a error by design. Sending requests at a rate more than
    our number of request units/sec.

Time_start:
    9:28
Time_end:
    9:37
Description:
    Selects test with multitenant for the option B implemented in google cloud.
    The database that we use is Mongodb.
    The test is running in two ways: with 10 threads (one per tenant) and in 
    only one thread.
Previous steps:
    A.Install the option B for mongodb in kubernetes:
        1. Clone the git repository clone/containers
        2. cd containers/KubernetesBlueprints/kubernetes1.4/simple/MultiTenant/persistent/googlepersistence/OPTIONB
        3. kubectl create -f .
    B. Run the insert method for the option B for inserts the collections
    PropertyTypes, IDXProperty76, IDXProperty78, IDXProperty79, BlobStore, with
    10 tenants. 
Instructions: 
    1. git clone arkis/databaseComparison
    2. Run the method multitenant_selects for option B with True for 
    the option thread.
    3. Run the method multitenant_selects for option B with False for 
    the option thread.
Result:
    - results/14-12-2016/bnot.json
